# Computer-Vision-Project
Human Kinetics Detector & Counter using python
Using Deep Learning algorithms and OpenCV library, we have developed a Human Detector and Counter System that can be effortlessly and efficiently embedded into any device.
Our approach includes-
Deep Learning model to detect humans and their trajectory.
Using Neural Networks to focus on key areas of crowd.
On device Machine Learning and Local Storage of Sensitive Data.
